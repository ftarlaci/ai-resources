# ai-resources

This repository is meant to be a living resource primarily for all the amazing mentees I have had the chance to mentor (and anyone else who is a learner and finds it useful) over the last couple years. It will include a curated, periodically updated list of multimodal resources on natural language processing, machine learning, and data science learning materials. Yes, this is one of those awesome lists of lists and in fact, also makes use of them. So enjoy!
